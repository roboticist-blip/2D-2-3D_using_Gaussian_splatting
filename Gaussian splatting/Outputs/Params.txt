✅ FINAL METRICS & EVALUATION CHECKLIST
(2D → 2.5D / 3D using Gaussian Splatting)
1️⃣ Image Quality Metrics (MANDATORY – instant reject if missing)
☐ PSNR (dB)
Novel view synthesis
Mean ± Std across test views
Same camera poses for all methods
☐ SSIM
Window size stated
Averaged over all test images
☐ LPIPS
Network used: Alex / VGG (must be stated)
Lower is better (explicitly mentioned)
📌 Report format
Method
PSNR ↑
SSIM ↑
LPIPS ↓
2️⃣ Depth / Geometry Consistency Metrics (CRITICAL for your claim)
☐ Depth RMSE
☐ Absolute Relative Error (AbsRel)
☐ Scale-Invariant Error (Si-log)
☐ Depth GT source clearly stated
Real GT depth OR
COLMAP pseudo-depth (explicitly acknowledged)
📌 If NO depth metrics → your “2.5D/3D” claim is invalid.
3️⃣ Rendering & Computational Performance (Gaussian Splatting ≠ NeRF)
☐ Rendering FPS
Resolution specified
GPU model stated
☐ Training time
Total optimization time
Iterations / epochs mentioned
☐ Memory usage (VRAM in GB)
📌 Reviewers LOVE efficiency numbers.
4️⃣ Representation Quality (Strong but Optional)
☐ Number of Gaussians
☐ Gaussian pruning ratio
☐ Scene density vs quality trade-off
📌 This makes your work look engineered, not hacked.
5️⃣ Baseline Comparison (ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT)
☐ COLMAP + Mesh Rendering
☐ Vanilla NeRF
☐ Official 3D Gaussian Splatting
☐ Same dataset, same train/test split
📌 Even one missing baseline = high rejection risk
6️⃣ Ablation Studies (SMALL but NON-NEGOTIABLE)
☐ With vs without depth guidance
☐ Sparse vs dense views
☐ Gaussian count vs quality
📌 Minimum: 1 table + 1 qualitative figure
7️⃣ Qualitative Results (SUPPORTING, not replacing metrics)
☐ Novel view renders (side-by-side)
☐ Failure cases shown
☐ Same camera viewpoints for all methods
🚫 Do NOT rely only on visuals — that screams “demo paper”.
8️⃣ Dataset & Protocol Transparency
☐ Dataset name + size
☐ Train / test split explained
☐ Number of input views stated
☐ Camera calibration source
📌 Missing protocol details = reviewer distrust.
9️⃣ Claims ↔ Metrics Consistency (MOST COMMON REJECTION)
☐ Every claim backed by a metric
☐ No words like “significant improvement” without numbers
☐ No claim of “true 3D reconstruction” without GT geometry
🔟 Paper-Ready Sanity Check
☐ Tables use ↑ ↓ arrows correctly
☐ Units mentioned everywhere
☐ Mean ± Std reported
☐ Reproducibility section included
